## Welcome to the personal website of James O'Neill

I don't really know what to do with this yet - but I feel this will be useful in the future.


### Content

There is currently no content lol

```
Here's some sample markdown code used to build this page:

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```


### Guess this is another header

Important pages have headers. There's nothing much on this page - but I want to feel important.
So I'm sticking in some headers.

### Support or Contact
If this page breaks - then you can contact me, I guess
